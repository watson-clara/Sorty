# Why You Should Hire Me

## Project Showcase: Sorty - File Comparison Tool

The Sorty project demonstrates my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to software engineering best practices. This project was developed specifically to showcase my skills relevant to this position.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Strong Object-Oriented Design

Sorty implements a clean, modular architecture following SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one clearly defined purpose
  - Example: `FileReader` only handles reading files, `LineByLineComparer` only handles comparison logic
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are extensible without modification
  - Example: New comparison algorithms can be added by implementing `ComparerInterface` without changing existing code
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types
  - Example: Any implementation of `LoggerInterface` can be used wherever a logger is needed
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Focused interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies
  - Example: `FileReaderInterface` and `FileWriterInterface` are separate instead of a single IO interface
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions
  - Example: `ComparisonService` depends on interfaces, not concrete implementations

The codebase demonstrates my ability to design maintainable, scalable software systems with clear separation of concerns.

### 2. Algorithm Optimization

The comparison algorithm showcases my ability to optimize for performance:
- **O(n) Time Complexity**: Efficient single-pass algorithm
- **Memory Optimization**: Stream-based processing for large files
- **Edge Case Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error management

This demonstrates my analytical thinking and ability to develop efficient solutions to complex problems.

### 3. Full-Stack Development

The project includes both backend and frontend components:
- **Backend**: PHP 8.1 with strict typing and PSR-4 compliance
- **Frontend**: Clean, responsive HTML/CSS interface
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation

This shows my versatility across the development stack.

### 4. DevOps & Containerization

The project includes complete Docker support:
- **Dockerfile**: Properly configured for PHP applications
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container setup for development
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for testing and deployment

This demonstrates my familiarity with modern deployment practices.

### 5. Test-Driven Development

The project follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: For individual components
- **Integration Tests**: For system behavior
- **Edge Case Tests**: For error handling and validation

This shows my commitment to code quality and reliability.

### 6. Security-Focused Development

Security best practices are implemented throughout:
- **Input Validation**: All file inputs are validated
- **Output Encoding**: Data is properly encoded when displayed
- **Resource Limits**: Maximum file size enforcement
- **Secure File Handling**: Proper temporary file management

This demonstrates my understanding of secure coding standards.

### 7. Modern JavaScript Development

The project demonstrates proficiency with modern JavaScript:
- **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring
- **DOM Manipulation**: Clean, efficient DOM updates
- **Event Handling**: Proper event delegation and management
- **Local Storage**: Client-side state persistence
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JS

```javascript
// Example of modern JS practices
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Use const/let for variable declarations
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('inputFile1');
    
    // Arrow functions for callbacks
    fileInput.addEventListener('change', () => {
        updateFileName(fileInput, fileName1);
        validateForm();
    });
    
    // Modern array methods
    ['dragenter', 'dragover', 'dragleave', 'drop'].forEach(eventName => {
        wrapper.addEventListener(eventName, preventDefaults, false);
    });
});
```

This demonstrates my ability to write clean, maintainable JavaScript code that enhances the user experience while following modern best practices.

## Soft Skills

Beyond technical abilities, this project demonstrates:

1. **Attention to Detail**: Clean code, comprehensive documentation, and thorough testing
2. **Problem-Solving**: Efficient algorithm design and error handling
3. **Communication**: Clear documentation and code comments
4. **Initiative**: Self-directed project development
5. **Learning Agility**: Implementation of modern best practices
